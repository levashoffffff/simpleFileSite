Project Analysis:

This project is a simple news site using PHP, with files serving as the database. Articles are stored as serialized PHP arrays in text files within the `data/` directory.

Key Points:

- Architecture:
  - `index.php`: The main file that either displays a list of all news items or a single news item (via `modules/news.php`), depending on the `?act=news` parameter in the URL.
  - `admin/index.php`: The admin panel for creating and editing articles.
  - `modules/readnews.php`: A script for reading all files from the `data/` folder and converting them into a news array.

- Critical Flaws:
  - Broken Authentication: The admin panel is inaccessible. The code checks the `$_SESSION['login']` session, but there is no mechanism to set it. The `templates/login.php` page is a copy of the article editor and does not contain a login form.
  - Insecure ID Generation: The ID for new articles is created by counting the files in the `data/` folder. This will lead to data overwriting if an article is deleted.
  - Missing Delete Function: There is no functionality in the admin panel to delete articles.
